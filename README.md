# MediCare<br>
The “MediCare” App will set the alarms according to the time set by the pharmacist and will remind the patient via notification about his medicines intake. It will also help the patients to locate the nearby medical stores. The purpose of this project is to look after individual health to avoid future health problems. Also, it reduces the effort of setting remainder manually.
